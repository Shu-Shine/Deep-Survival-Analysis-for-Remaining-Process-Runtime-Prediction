# Deep-Survival-Analysis-for-Remaining-Process-Runtime-Prediction

## Motivation
In today's fast-paced business landscape, accurate prediction of remaining process runtimes holds paramount importance for effective decision-making, resource allocation, and operational planning. However, achieving precise predictions in complex and dynamic processes remains a challenge. Traditional methods often struggle to capture intricate patterns, especially when faced with high-dimensional data. 

This inherent challenge has motivated researchers to explore advanced techniques that can address the limitations of conventional approaches. Deep learning, with its capability to extract intricate patterns from high-dimensional data, presents a promising avenue for enhancing the accuracy of remaining process runtime predictions. 

By employing deep learning-based survival analysis, we aim to propose new study ideas from interdisciplinary point views. This study aims to not only enhance prediction accuracy but also to unravel the underlying assumptions and limitations of these models within the context of time-to-event prediction.
